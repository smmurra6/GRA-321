    Its History    
    </h3>
    <p>The Colorado is one of the great rivers of North America. Formed in 
Southern Utah by the confluence of the Green and Grand, it intersects the 
northwestern corner of Arizona, and, becoming 1 the eastern boundary of 
Nevada and California, flows southward until it reaches tidewater in the Gulf 
of California, Mexico. It drains a territory of 300,000 square miles, and, 
traced back to the rise of its principal source, is 2,000 miles long. At two 
points, Needles and Yuma on the California boundary, it is crossed by a rail- 
road. Elsewhere its course lies far from Caucasian settlements and far from 
the routes of common travel, in the heart of a vast region fenced on the one 
hand by arid plains or deep forests and on the other by formidable mountains.

    The early Spanish explorers first reported it to the civilized world in 1540, 
two separate expeditions becoming acquainted with the river for a compara- 
tively short distance above its mouth, and another, journeying from the Moki 
Pueblos northwestward across the desert, obtaining the first view of the Big 
Canyon, failing in every effort to descend the canyon wall, and spying the 
river only from afar.

    Again, in 1776, a Spanish priest traveling southward through Utah struck 
off from the Virgin River to the southeast and found a practicable crossing at 
a point that still bears the name " Vado de los Padres."

    For more than eighty years thereafter the Big Canyon remained unvisited 
except by the Indian, the Mormon herdsman, and the trapper, although the 
Sitgreaves expedition of 1851, journeying westward, struck the river about 
150 miles above Yuma, and Lieutenant Whipple in 1854 made a survey for a 
practicable railroad route along the thirty-fifth parallel, where the Santa Fe 
Pacific has since been constructed.
